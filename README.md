# Motive of This Project
To give Rural and Semi urban people a Health Assistant which gave them a short understandable answer in their own language.

# Table of Contents 
1. WhatsApp Trigger — receives incoming user message.
2. AI Agent — collects memory, runs reasoning (Think), chooses/calls LLM(s).
3. Auto-fixing Output Parser — ensures LLM output matches expected structured schema; attempts auto-fix using LLM if parsing fails.
4. Item List Output Parser (HEALTH ADVICE) — converts structured output into message-ready items.
5. Send Message (WhatsApp) — sends the final reply back to the user.
6. Memory — conversation + response stored for future context.
(Extras: alternate/supplementary LLMs like Google Gemini / OpenAI, and an internal “Think” tool used by the agent for multi-step reasoning.)
